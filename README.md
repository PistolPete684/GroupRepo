# GroupRepo
Peter, Juniper and Rama's group git project. 


Create a website repository on GitHub in groups of 3.

Each group member will take on one or two of the following roles:

Website Lead (this one should be doubled up with another)
Create a private repo, and ideally all branches, and invite other students in your group to edit it
NOTE: You can all just push/pull from one repo, no pull requests required
Invite the instructor as well, so I can review it (use kevin.bourque@nbcc.ca) 
Review all changes before merging them from the development into the master branch
Page Creator
Creates all HTML files and HTML tags in files such as links, divs, img, etc.
No content (titles, text, images, etc.), just use placeholders
Designer
Creates all CSS which includes all design, colour, font, and layout choices
Content Creator
Create all content and images (filling information into pre-existing tags)
Create a website that "sells" three products of your choosing. The site must contain a main landing page with links to individual pages each with a product for sale. "Buying" the item simply brings you to a shopping cart page (does not need to be functional).

Proper use of branching and merging is expected. Be sure to have branches for the following:

Production Ready and Tested Code (Master, 1 branch)
Development (1 branch)
CSS (1 branch)
A branch for each product (3 branches) and feature (shopping cart, 1 branch)
Branch(es) for content updates (at least 1, more if you want)
Do NOT delete any branches after merging as I want to see them in the repository.

The website code is not explicitly being graded, but I do expect it to meet the requirements above, and I will deduct marks for any code on the site that is really, really awful.

Simply submit the address to your repository to the assignment dropbox. Only one group member needs to make a submission.
